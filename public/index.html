                    it, to limit its influence, to channel it (into sex, for example), to deny it, to enjoy it and, yes,
                    dammit, to make her respond! Even though I know that Emily and I have absolutely no chance of making
                    a life together, the thought of her is an obsession. I am in the position of passionately wanting
                    someone I don't want at all and could find no use for if I had her."</p>
